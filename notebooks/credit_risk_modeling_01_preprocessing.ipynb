    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "More than ever before Credit Risk Models are being used to steer strategic decisions in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks use credit risk models to help decide who to make loans to and how to manage the risk of those loans.  Part of that risk management is ensuring they have enough capital (spare cash) to weather shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks use complex internal risk models, they are subject to regulatory supervision, and are ultimately subject to market discipline. They must have a minimum amount of holding capital as a buffer against shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Minimum buffer capital is dynamic and the provisions a bank holds are directly determined by:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Credit risk models\n",
    "        Market risk models (liquidity, ir, commodities)\n",
    "        Operational risk models\n",
    "        Fraud risk models\n",
    "        Insurance risk models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Capstone Project we will focus exclusively on Credit Risk Models, which in itself is a broad and deep subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulation allows models that use big data, machine learning techniques and analytical models, and these models are subject to regulatory oversight. Regulations define the inputs and outputs of the models, and how these outputs are combined to determine capital and provisions. Impact of model errors impact profitability, solvency, shareholders and the macroeconomy as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for almost all data science we need to ensure that our data and our models are of good quality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1) Credit Risk Models and Capital\n",
    "\n",
    "In this capstone project we will estimate the amount of capital that needs to be held against individual loans based on their expected loss, which is a measure of the level of loss that can be expected losses are in normal circumstances. Banks do not expect everyone to repay their loans. Expcected Loss is made up of three credit risk components:"

    "#### 4) Industry Practice and Expected Outcomes\n",

    "LGD: 6-8 characteristics: LTV Loan to value, degree of collateral are usually included, and can be default risk included sometimes. 20-30% R-squared. This is worrying as it has a linear impact on capital. How can this be improved?\n",

Traditional banks have legacy overheads associated with a bricks and mortar presence, legacy systems, legacy loans and legacy customers (those reluctant to move online).\n",
